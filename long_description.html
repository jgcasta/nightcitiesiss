Georeference Cities from ISS
=============================

Help us to georeference the location of cities and features which appear in the ISS images.

We are members of the  Group of Extragalactic Astrophysics and Astronomical Instrumentation from Universidad Coplutense de Madrid [GUAIX](http://guaix.fis.ucm.es/about). Among our activities is light pollution study and the energy consumption derived from it. We use images taken from the International Space Station as part of our investigations, provided by Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit, NASA-Johnson Space Center. "The Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth."

To compare the images with the different light sources on the earth, we need to georeference every picture. This is a process of associating a physical map with spatial locations to the picture, where locations are represented using a coordinate reference system, in this case Longitude and Latitude. Due to the large number of images, we need your help. Some of these pictures are from unknown locations for us, and it is very difficult identify some features on the picture.

However, a lot of people around the world will know the cities. We need you identify some features and connect them with some point on a map. This application allows you to do this.

The process is very easy. The ISS image will be loaded in the left pannel and a map on the right one. For low speed internet connections, you have to wait for the final large ISS image, please be patient . You can choose between Google Maps, street and satellite,  and Open Street Maps views to get the best information about every site. Also you have an interactive map showing 2012 night image of the Earth from NPP-VIIRS satellite. If we know the position of the center of the picture, this will be marked as a red dot. The aim is rotate and move te picture to allow you to identify some features you know where are they located. You have some simple tools to make zoomin, zoomout and drag the picture. Even you can rotate it click on Shift and left mouse button. When you identify one, just click on it and a pair of XY coordinates will appear in the XY list. Now you have to identify the same feature on the map and click it. The longitud and latitud pair of coordinates will appear on the list.

If you make a mistake, you can delete one point. Just select it and click on "Delete".

When you finish to select points, click on Save, and another image will be loaded. If you don't know about the picture, just click on "Don't know".

If you need more information about this picture, you can click on "ISS picture data", and NASA data will be displayed. At last, you also can share it through Twitter

We are very grateful for your participation in this project

Also you can contribute on our other apps [Lost at night](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/LostAtNight/) (find unlocated images) and [DarkSkies](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/darkskies/) (Identifying Images).
